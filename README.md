Linear regression is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship between two or more variables.
In simple linear regression, there are two variables: a dependent variable and an independent variable.
The key point in the linear regression is that our dependent value should be continuous and cannot be a discreet value. However, the independent variable(s) can be measured on either a categorical or continuous measurement scale.
There are two types of linear regression models. They are: simple regression and multiple regression.

Simple linear regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable.
